//Goal: be able to save data from all 3 arrays on the wesbite
    //cannot use local storage (needs to be accessed form multiple devices)
    // attempt to write to a file saved on website (via save button)

    
//open file with read permissions and get the data out
    //item, amount, place each saved as own array, so substring based on []
