    descend: Goes first letter, then second letter, then third, numbers at end ect. until no change in 2 passes, sort via maximum
    none: general display
    after sorting gets index of each item from original array(find name in array) and then uses that for reference for
    index of other 2 arrays*/

    if none sort smallest
    smallest: smallest number first, change by min value (if same amount sort by alpha)
    largest: largest number first, change by max value (if same amount sort by alpha)
    After sorting finds the amount of each item in original array and gets index value, uses this for other 2
    arrays*/


//Sorts by location
    //same as alpha sorter but location column instead of name
        //Different arrays for 

//Search bar
    //for length of array, see if item name or location includes key, if true: get index (loop counter)
    //for the set of items, put into new arrays, displays arrays
