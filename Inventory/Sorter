//creates array?

//Sorts by name
    /*Checks current sorting style, if sorted by alpha ascend change to descen, if descend cancel sort
    if none sort ascend */
    //ascend: numbers smallest to largest, Goes first letter, then second letter, then third, ect. until no change in 2 passes, sort via minimum
    //descend: Goes first letter, then second letter, then third, numbers at end ect. until no change in 2 passes, sort via maximum
    //none: general display 

//Sorts by number
    /*Checks current sorting style, if sorted by number smallest change to largest, if largest cancel sort
    if none sort smallest */
    //smallest: smallest number first, change by min value (if same amount sort by alpha)
    //largest: largest number first, change by max value (if same amount sort by alpha)


//Sorts by location
    /*Checks current sorting style, if sorted by alpha ascend change to descen, if descend cancel sort
    if none sort ascend */
    //same as alpha sorter but location based, then go by alpha

//Search bar
    //search name and location for substring, if found the item stays in table, otherwise removed from table
